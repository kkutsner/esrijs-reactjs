My "Hello world!" project using EsriJS and ReactJS.

The app has been created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool and EsriJS is linked using [esri-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esri-loader) and [esri-loader-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esri-loader-react)

Steps to run as usual:
```
npm install
npm start
```
